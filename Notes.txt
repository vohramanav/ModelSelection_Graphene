Strategy:
Consider AIREBO and Tersoff potentials

Part 1: Motivate calibration of the two potentials based on their 
comparison with experimental data in a range, 200K-800K. Further,
motivate comparison of the two potentials in a Bayesian setting.

Part 2:
Build a reduced space surrogate for each potential using active subspaces
1. Monitor convergence of the dominant eigenvector starting with 10 points
and adding 5 points at each iteration.
2. Once converged, determine the dimensionality of the dominant eigenspace
based on the eigenvalue spectrum.
3. For the considered dimensionality, explore the degree of the polynomial
for the case of 1-D and 2-D surrogates using verification and validation errors.
4. For higher dimensional surrogates, use PCE and estimte loo cross-validation
error and validation error. 
5. Finalize the RSS

Part 3:
Perform GSA using RSS for each potential to see if the sensitivities have
changed significantly from 200 to 800.

Part 4: 
Perform a Bayesian calibration of the important parameters using data at
200 and 800 K

Part 5:
Compute Bayes factors for each potential using data based on model 
predictions at intermediate points.
